## About Me

<img src="https://xuanlu11.github.io/xuanlu.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Xuan Lu (È≤ÅÊóã)**.<br>

I‚Äôm an undergraduate student in Data Science (Mathematics Category) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (graduating in 2026). My research centers on machine learning, computational imaging, and hyperspectral image restoration, advised by [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny2mn-cAAAAJ). <br>

I have contributed as the first author to a manuscript submitted to the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), and as a co-first author to another manuscript submitted to NeurIPS 2025. 

<!--**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2026 Fall admission.</font>**-->
**I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2026 Fall admission**, focusing on image/video/3D generation, computational imaging, and sparsity-aware modelling.

## Research Experience & Interests
**Research Projects**
- **BRBCN: Block-wise Image Restoration with Inter Block‚Äôs Communication Network (Apr. 2024-Mar. 2025)**

Proposed a unified CNN-Transformer framework for image restoration that effectively combines local and global representations. 
Submitted to International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV).

- **Unified Dual-Speed Deep Unfolding Learning for Spectral Compressive Imaging (Nov. 2024-Present)**

Developed a dual-speed framework that enables self-supervised, per-sample test-time adaptation via a dual-domain loss, which achieved state-of-the-art on out-of-distribution data. Submitted to a top-tier conference. 

- **Simulation and Optimization of the "Bench Dragon" Folk Dance (Sep. 2024)**

Modeled and simulated the motion of the traditional southeastern Chinese ‚ÄúBench Dragon‚Äù folk dance using equidistant spiral trajectories. Achieved high accuracy and practical outcomes. National First Prize, 2024 CUMCM.

**Research Interests**

My research focuses on bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and practical algorithm design, and currently focuses on:

- **Spectral Compressive imaging and Sparse Optimization**
- **Low-Level Vision and Computational Imaging**
- **Image/Video/3D Generation/Reconstruction**
