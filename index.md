## About Me

<img src="https://xuanlu11.github.io/xuanlu.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi, I'm **Xuan Lu (鲁旋)**.<br>

I’m an undergraduate student in Data Science (Mathematics Category) at Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen (graduating in 2026). My research centers on machine learning, computational imaging, and hyperspectral image restoration, advised by [Prof. Yongyong Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ny2mn-cAAAAJ). <br>

I have contributed as the first author to a manuscript submitted to the International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV), and as a co-first author to another manuscript submitted to NeurIPS 2025. 

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for 2026 Fall admission.</font>**
